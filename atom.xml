   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I created this site primarily as a learning exercise. I program a lot, but, unlike a lot of other programmers, what I program typically has nothing whatsoever to do with the world wide web. Or even a corporate intra-web. Given the ubiquity of web apps I thought it might be a good idea to be at least minimally familiar with web programming. Enough that when developers talk about web stuff my blank uncomprehending stare doesn’t make them wonder if I really know how to program at all. Backend web stuff is actually pretty similar to the stuff I do every day, so for me this was mostly about the front-end, client-side web. Since for me learning by doing is the only way to go, I needed to make a website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with using Jekyll to generate a static site, since that seemed like the easiest possible way to get a useful site. After realizing just how easy that was, I realized I needed a more substantial project if I actually wanted to learn anything. I’ve been using Pomodoro timers as a productivity tool recently, and decided that writing my own would make a good project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After building the site it seemed silly not to actually publish it, so here it is. I guess I have a blog now. I don’t know that I will end up posting with any regularity, but who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
